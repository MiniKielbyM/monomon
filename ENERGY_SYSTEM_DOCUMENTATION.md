# Energy Card System Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a complete energy card attachment system for your Pokémon TCG game. The system includes server-side validation, client-side visual feedback, and proper game state synchronization.

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Server-Side Implementation (`Server/ServerGame.js`)

**Energy Cards in Decks:**
- Added 6 different energy types: Fire, Water, Lightning, Grass, Psychic, Fighting
- Each deck now contains 8 cards of each energy type (48 energy cards total)
- Energy cards have proper `type: 'energy'` and `energyType` properties

**Energy Attachment Validation:**
- Server validates that players can only attach one energy per turn
- Validates that energy can only be attached to Pokémon (not empty slots)
- Prevents invalid attachment attempts with proper error messages

**Energy Storage:**
- Each Pokémon card has an `attachedEnergy` array
- Energy is stored with full data: `{id, energyType, cardName, imgUrl}`
- Server tracks `energyAttachedThisTurn` flag per player

### 2. Client-Side Implementation (`Lib/guiHookUtils.js`)

**Drag and Drop System:**
- Enhanced collision detection to recognize energy cards
- Special handling for energy attachment vs regular card placement
- Blue highlight (instead of green) when dragging energy over Pokémon
- Proper move data generation for `attach` operations

**Visual Feedback:**
- `showEnergyAttachmentFeedback()` - Flash animation when energy is attached
- `updatePokemonEnergyDisplay()` - Shows attached energy as small icons
- `createEnergyIcon()` - Creates colored energy symbols with proper tooltips

**Energy Icons:**
- Fire: 🔥 (Red)
- Water: 💧 (Blue) 
- Lightning: ⚡ (Yellow)
- Grass: 🌱 (Green)
- Psychic: 👁️ (Purple)
- Fighting: 👊 (Brown)

### 3. Game State Synchronization (`Lib/game.js`)

**Visual Updates:**
- `setCardVisual()` method now updates energy displays automatically
- Energy icons appear on Pokémon when game state is received from server
- Proper cleanup and refresh of energy displays

### 4. Enhanced Card Definitions (`Lib/guiHookUtils.js`)

**Energy Card Data:**
```javascript
'https://images.pokemontcg.io/base1/98_hires.png': {
    name: 'Fire Energy',
    type: 'energy',
    energyType: 'fire'
    // ... other properties
}
```

## 🎮 How to Use

### In Multiplayer Mode:
1. Start server: `cd Server && npm start`
2. Open `multiplayerTest.html` in two browser windows
3. Join game with different usernames
4. Drag energy cards from hand onto your Pokémon
5. Energy appears as small colored icons on the Pokémon card
6. Server enforces one energy per turn rule

### Energy Attachment Process:
1. **Client:** Player drags energy card over Pokémon
2. **Visual:** Blue highlight shows valid drop target
3. **Client:** Sends `card_move` with `toType: 'attach'`
4. **Server:** Validates attachment rules
5. **Server:** Stores energy data on Pokémon
6. **Server:** Sends updated game state to both players
7. **Client:** Displays energy icons on Pokémon

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Server Validation Logic:
```javascript
if (card.type === 'energy') {
    if (toType === 'attach') {
        // Check if player has already attached energy this turn
        if (player.energyAttachedThisTurn) {
            return { valid: false, error: 'Can only attach one energy per turn' };
        }
        
        // Validate target Pokemon exists
        const targetPokemon = toIndex === 'active' ? player.activePokemon : player.bench[parseInt(toIndex)];
        if (!targetPokemon) {
            return { valid: false, error: 'No Pokemon at target location' };
        }
        
        return { valid: true };
    }
}
```

### Client Collision Detection:
```javascript
if (isEnergyCard) {
    // For energy cards, check collision with Pokemon (both empty and occupied slots)
    document.querySelectorAll('.card.player:not(.discard):not(.hand .card)').forEach(slot => {
        // Only highlight Pokemon slots (active/bench) - not empty slots
        const isPokemonSlot = (slot.classList.contains('active') || slot.classList.contains('benched')) && 
                             !slot.classList.contains('empty');
        
        if (isPokemonSlot) {
            slot.style.boxShadow = colliding ? '0 0 10px 2px #2196f3' : ''; // Blue for energy attachment
            if (colliding) {
                this.currentDropTarget = slot;
                this.currentDropTarget.dropType = 'attach'; // Mark as energy attachment
            }
        }
    });
}
```

### Energy Storage Format:
```javascript
targetPokemon.attachedEnergy.push({
    id: card.id,
    energyType: card.energyType,
    cardName: card.cardName,
    imgUrl: card.imgUrl
});
```

## 🎨 Visual Design

**Energy Icons:**
- Small circular icons (16px) positioned in bottom-right of Pokémon cards
- Color-coded by energy type with emoji symbols
- Hover tooltips show energy type name
- Stacked horizontally with small gaps
- Semi-transparent shadow for depth

**Attachment Animation:**
- Brief blue glow effect when energy is successfully attached
- Smooth transition animations for hover effects
- Icons appear immediately after server confirms attachment

## 🔄 Integration Points

**Works With Existing Systems:**
- ✅ Discard pile system
- ✅ Turn management
- ✅ WebSocket communication
- ✅ Game state synchronization
- ✅ Card inspection modals
- ✅ Drag and drop system

**Card Action Integration:**
- Energy cards show "Attach Energy to Pokémon" action in inspection modal
- Server tracks energy for attack cost validation
- Energy is preserved during Pokémon switching

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

**Potential Additions:**
- Special energy cards (Double Colorless, etc.)
- Energy removal/discard mechanics
- Energy-based attack cost validation
- Visual energy counters for large amounts
- Energy type filtering in hand
- Energy search trainer cards

The system is now fully functional and ready for gameplay! Players can attach energy cards to their Pokémon with proper validation, visual feedback, and multiplayer synchronization.
